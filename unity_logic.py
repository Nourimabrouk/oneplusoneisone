UnityLogic.py: A Symbolic Framework for 1+1=1
---------------------------------------------
This code is a pure demonstration of logic and mathematics.
There are no dependencies outside of standard python library.

The focus is on the "how" of 1+1=1 by crafting a logic where
the operation '+' yields unity rather than multiplicity.
