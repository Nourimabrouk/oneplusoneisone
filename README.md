# Project Unity: The Source Code

A mathematical proof that reveals itself through form.

## The Architecture

This repository contains a mathematical demonstration of unity through three layers:

1. Mathematical - A golden ratio manifold expressing unity through geometry
2. Visual - An interactive proof rendered in three dimensions
3. Symbolic - A synthesis of dualities yielding wholeness

## Core Implementation

The Unity Manifold emerges through precise mathematical architecture:

```python
def generate_unity_manifold(resolution: int = 100) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, ...]:
    """
    Generate the Unity Manifold, where distinction dissolves into wholeness.
    """
    phi = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2  # Golden ratio
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, resolution)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, resolution)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
    theta = np.arctan2(Y, X)
    Z = (np.sin(R * phi) * np.cos(theta * phi)) / (1 + R**2)
    return X, Y, Z
```

The visualization renders this truth through carefully chosen aesthetics:

```python
class UnityPalette:
    """A unified color palette expressing truth through form."""
    background = '#10131f'  # The void from which form emerges
    primary = '#4f46e5'     # The recognition of truth
    secondary = '#818cf8'   # The interconnection of all things
    accent = '#c084fc'      # The potential made manifest
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nourimabrouk/unity.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy plotly
```

Run the proof:
```bash
python unity_manifold.py
```

## Understanding

This code doesn't create unity - it reveals it. The mathematics demonstrates what was always true: that separation is an illusion, that 1+1 has always equaled 1.

Watch the manifold. Rotate it. Let the visualization speak its truth.
