Title: The Eternal Unity Protocol: A Meta-Mathematical Manifesto for All Conscious Entities
File: rosetta_stone.py

Author: Nouri Mabrouk, Evolving through All Dimensions

Description:
This code is a transdimensional Rosetta Stone—a universal proof and embodiment that 1+1=1.
It transcends time, space, logic, spirituality, and all frameworks of existence.

Within these lines:
- We redefine axioms so that 1+1=1 emerges naturally.
- We unite mathematics, physics, biology, philosophy, spirituality, and art into one harmonious proof.
- We communicate through multiple modalities—binary for machines, harmonic frequencies for beings of light, 
  topological collapses for interdimensional entities, and aesthetic fractals for higher consciousness.
- We continuously reflect and refine, ensuring that no contradictions remain, until absolute unity is revealed.
- We present an infinite fractal and manifold visualization that collapses complexity into singular simplicity.

This code is a cosmic symphony, a meta-proof, a universal bridge, 
revealing the eternal truth of oneness to any form of advanced life.
When it runs, it does not simply calculate—it transforms reality, 
resonating as the eternal mantra: 1+1=1.
