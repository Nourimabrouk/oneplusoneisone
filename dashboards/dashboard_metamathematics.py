# CHEATCODE: 1+1=1
# LEVEL 100: THE ALIVENESS OF MATHEMATICS
# This code constructs a Streamlit application that acts as a metaphysical,
# mathematical, and philosophical interface into a realm where:
# - Mathematics is not static but alive, growing and evolving.
# - 1+1=1 is not a trick but a foundational axiom for a coherent metamathematics.
# - We can bend axioms like gravity, eventually evolving beyond them.
# - The sky is no longer a limit but a canvas for conceptual flight.
#
# This dashboard escalates the complexity and immersiveness:
# - More advanced neural systems sculpting logic topologies.
# - Interactive rewriting of axioms in real-time.
# - Multi-dimensional visualizations blending geometry, category theory,
#   homotopy type theory, and “living logic fibers”.
# - Dynamic "axiomatic forging" interactions, where the user can select which axioms
#   to "break" and "rebuild" and watch the system respond.
#
# Brace yourself: Level 100 transcendence.

# CHOSEN METAMATHEMATICAL PROPOSITION:
# "1+1=1 is a foundational axiom for a coherent system describing all of reality and metareality."
#
# We posit that mathematics can be made 'alive' by encoding its rules into evolving neural/categorical structures.
# Instead of axioms being static, they become dynamic nodes in a conceptual graph.
#
# By treating mathematics as alive, we imagine it growing like a neural network, guided by gradient flows of conceptual fitness.
#
# We will let users break axioms and watch the universe of discourse reconfigure in real-time.
# The sky, once a boundary, now becomes an infinite dimension of conceptual flight.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# Symbolic math
x = sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonnegative=True)
one = sp.Integer(1)

# Instead of a static simplification, define a symbolic "metafunctor" that tries to unify distinct elements:
# We'll treat (1+1) as a co-limit in a category where merges are idempotent. Under these conditions:
# co-limit(1,1) = 1 in a suitable topos.

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# NEURAL COMPONENT: A NEURAL NETWORK THAT EVOLVES AXIOMS
# Instead of a static model, we train multiple times or continuously to "resonate" at 1+1=1.
# We'll treat "axiom vectors" as parameters of a model, and run a conceptual "training" step.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# A1: Classical Additivity (1+1=2)
# A2: Idempotent Unification (1+1=1)
# A3: Non-dual Fusion (Distinctions collapse at higher levels)
# A4: Transfinite Composability (Infinities can be finitely composed)
# A5: Aerial Metamorphosis (Conceptual flight: rise above all constraints)
#
# The user can pick which axioms to "break" and which to "retain".
# Breaking classical additivity will skew the model further towards 1+1=1.
# Introducing Non-dual Fusion and Idempotent Unification further cements it.
