# METAMATHEMATICAL CONCEPT:
# We choose a radical proposition:
# "Infinite multiplicity is finitely constructible and isomorphic to unity."
# Equivalently, we will show: 1 + 1 = 1, not by mere arithmetic trickery,
# but by reshaping the conceptual fabric of logic, category, and existence.
#
# We consider a topological braiding of “laws of thermodynamics” into a
# self-referential category that collapses distinctions at a higher homotopy level.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# SYMBOLIC MATH & CATEGORY THEORY COMPONENT
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# We'll define symbolic variables and a symbolic "proof".
x = sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonnegative=True)
one = sp.Integer(1)
zero = sp.Integer(0)
infinity = sp.oo

# A "proof" that unity and multiplicity are indistinguishable under certain exotic functors.
# Consider a category C where objects are 'ontic states' and morphisms are 'transcendences'.
# We'll only gesture at this: Let f: 1 -> 1+1 be an identity morphism in a topos where '+' is no longer additive but a form of "co-product" that collapses.
# We'll show a simplified symbolic identity using sympy:
symbolic_identity = sp.simplify(one + one - one)  # intentionally trivial expression


# -----------------------------------------------------------
# AI/NEURAL COMPONENT: A NEURAL NETWORK THAT OPTIMIZES A "METATRUTH"
# We'll create a simple PyTorch model that tries to converge the parameters
# such that (1+1-1) ~ 1 in a transformed latent space—metaphorically performing
# gradient descent over reality’s parameters.

# QUANTUM & PHYSICS COMPONENT:
# We can simulate a mini "quantum superposition" of states |0> and |1> and show that their combination leads to a normalized state ~ |1>.
# Just a playful demonstration.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# Quantum superposition: state = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2)
# If we redefine measurement basis such that |1> + |1> normalizes back to |1>, we get a conceptual "collapse".
vec = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), 1/np.sqrt(2)]) # equal superposition
# Conceptual 'collapse' to a single state by a "non-standard" measurement:
# We'll just pick the projection onto the |1> state: P1 = |1><1|
# Probability of measuring |1> is 1/2, but let's "redefine" the measurement:
projection_1 = np.array([0,1])
proj_value = np.dot(projection_1, vec)**2
# proj_value ~ 1/2, but conceptually we treat this scenario as if the vector equals unity after some topological braiding.


# -----------------------------------------------------------
